# Toorla Compiler

This repository contains the implementaion of Toorla language compiler using java and of course from scrath. 
Toorla language has different features and almost all of its features can be mapped to Java language. A large fraction of the functionalities available in Java are also available in Toorla and this made the task alot harder. 

Different modules are included in this compiler just like a normal compiler: 

* AST
* Code Generator
* Name Analyzer
* Type Checker
* Visitor 
* Grammar processor

Java, ANTLR, and Jasmin were used in different parts of the project from checking the grammar to generating bytecodes.
